INFO
===

The info panel will display contextual data based on application state and focus.
For now it is used as a todo for this sample...

TODO
---
  * Colored buttons
  * button glyphs
  * placeholders for attribute
  * buttons keep focus which is bad - fix or use <a> instead
  * reload panels based on id system TBD
  * Make saved/new/... real state variables
